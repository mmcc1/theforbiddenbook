# The Forbidden Book

The Forbidden Book is an exploration into information theory.  In theory, all expressible information should already exist.  There should be no difference between creativity, search, discovery and random means of information retrieval, other than time.  

The Forbidden book generates random bytes and displays them as text and images.  What will you find?

Theoretical Note:

In working with this I discovered what we consider random, in terms of PRNGs or TRNGs, is not really usefully random in the context of The Forbidden Book.  Mainly because the The Forbidden Book is seeking some order in the random, which RNGs and TRNGs go out of their way to remove.

At present, The Forbidden Book is using a cryptographic RNG, so it requires a new RNG to become useful.

How do we design that RNG?
