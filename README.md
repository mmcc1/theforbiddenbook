# The Forbidden Book

The Forbidden Book is an exploration into information theory.  In theory, all expressible information should already exist.  For example, if we could compute every possible permutation of a 1MB file, we would have everything that could ever be expressed in 1MB. All the stories, songs, technology and video that have ever been created, or could be created.  

While they seem different, there is no difference between creativity, memory, search, discovery, inference and random means of information retrieval, other than time.  

The Forbidden book generates random bytes and displays them as text and images.  What will you find?

Theoretical Note:

The Forbidden Book works best with RNGs which do not attempt to maintain a proper distribution of values.

Extended Research

One of the most interesting possibilities that arises from the software is the tantalising prospect that structure exists to comprehensible information that could be used to compute the location of previously unknown comprehensible information.  Think of spidering the web and you'll get the basic idea.

This may seem a strange notion at first, however, there is a structure to language, a relationship between words, meaning and ultimately physics.  The connection to physics implies a certain level of computablity, which we leverage every day in the form of dictionaries and word nets.

Is there a formula of the E=MC^2 ilk in terms of comprehensible information?  One that could separate fact from fiction too?
