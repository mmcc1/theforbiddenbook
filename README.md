# The Forbidden Book

The Forbidden Book is an exploration into information theory.  In theory, all expressible information should already exist.  There should be no difference between creativity, search, discovery and random means of information retrieval, other than time.  

The Forbidden book generates random bytes and displays them as text and images.  What will you find?

Theoretical Note:

In working with this I discovered what we consider random, in terms of PRNGs or TRNGs, is not really usefully random in the context of The Forbidden Book.  Mainly because the The Forbidden Book is seeking some order in the random, which RNGs and TRNGs go out of their way to remove.

At present, The Forbidden Book is using a cryptographic RNG, so it requires a new RNG to become useful.

How do we design that RNG?

Extended Research

One of the most interesting possibilities that arises from the software is the tantalising prospect that structure exists to comprehensible information that could be used to compute the location of previously unknown comprehensible information.  Think of spidering the web and you'll get the basic idea.

This may seem a strange notion at first, however, there is a structure to language, a relationship between words, meaning and ultimately physics.  The connection to physics implies a certain level of computablity, which we leverage every day in the form of dictionaries and word nets.

Is there a formula of the E=MC^2 ilk in terms of comprehensible information?  One that could separate fact from fiction too?
